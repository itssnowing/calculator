Basic math calculator.

*My Thoughts:*

Fun challenge, although I'm not super great at math, so this was confusing sometimes. Despite that, it only took me a few hours to complete this, which was surprising. Took longer than the Etch-a-Sketch project though. I didn't implement decimal space limits / rounding because I forgot to before committing, although it's pretty easy to do with .toFixed(). I'm just looking forward to playing with some other things for now, so I'll add that later.
